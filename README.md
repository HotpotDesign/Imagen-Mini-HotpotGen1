# HotpotGen1

## Overview
Our mission at [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai?s=hotpotgen1) is to help the world create.

As part of our research, we are creating HotpotGen1, a basic version of Google Brain's incredible text-to-image diffusion model, [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/). HotpotGen1 is inspired by Dall-E Mini and will be an open-source, mini version of Imagen -- Imagen-Mini if you will. (Note: we are not affiliated with Google.)

According to Google:
> Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model.

Our goal is to publicly release HotpotGen1 by September 30, 2022.
