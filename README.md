# HotpotGen1

## Overview
Our mission at [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai?s=hotpotgen1) is to help the world create.

As part of our research, we are building HotpotGen1, a basic version of Google Brain's incredible text-to-image diffusion model, [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/). In Google's words, Imagen offers "an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model." 

Inspired by Dall-E Mini, HotpotGen1 will be an open-source, miniaturized version of Imagen -- Imagen-Mini if you will. (Note: we are not affiliated with Google.)

The repos of [Lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch) and [AssemblyAI](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/MinImagen) have been valuable guides during our process.

Our goal is to publicly HotpotGen1 by September 20, 2022.

If you find it exciting to work on hard problems at the intersection of creativity and technology, we are hiring in multiple areas: ML, design, and web development. Details: [hotpot.ai/jobs](https://hotpot.ai/jobs).
